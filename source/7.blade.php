	The place that knows about .com's is a "root name server".  Once your computer knows where the root name server for .com's is, it asks the root name server: &ldquo;Where are the records for, say, dns-explained.com?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
	And the root name server will answer with the &ldquo;name servers&rdquo; for the domain that you are asking about.
